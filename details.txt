For this exercise, we’d like you to write a small application that pulls people
and starship data from https://swapi.dev/ and save that into a database with its relations.



Guidelines:

- Use a language/database of your choice.

- Use GitHub to store and manage your code.

- Include any setup instructions that we may need.

- Send us a link to your repository when you are done.

- Aim to spend less than 2 hours on this exercise.

- Once our team has reviewed your code, we will reach out with details around next steps.


Things we are looking for:

Debugging other people’s code is hard. Naming is hard. Software is hard. Show us how you
would organize and write your code in such a way as to make it easy for another dev to
understand, debug, or extend it.

Many things can go wrong with your application, e.g. http, database connection errors a
nd many other things. Try to handle a few of the common errors and add comments/TODOs for other
ones you can think of.

Understanding of relational data. How do people and starships relate to each other?
